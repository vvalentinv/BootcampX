-- We need to make sure that we can contact students through a phone number or through email. 
-- If student's don't have a phone number or email associated with their account, we'll need to message them on slack to update their details.
-- Get all of the students that don't have an email or phone number.
-- Get their name, id, and cohort_id.
SELECT name, id, cohort_id
  FROM students
  WHERE phone IS NULL OR email IS NULL;
